# ANTLR4 Parser for B
**DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN ANYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
RATHER, IN ANYTHING AT ALL.
DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT USING IT.
STUFF _WILL_ BREAK.
YOU _WILL_ CRY.
WE WILL _NOT CARE_.**

This repo contains a standalone version of the
_still in development_ ANTLR4 Parser feature of the
[ProB Parsers Library](https://github.com/bendisposto/probparsers).

The code is still in a very early and experimental state.
Just do not use it unless you have contacted us
and we deemed usage of this library suitable for your goals.
