# ANTLR4 Parser for B
**DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN ANYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
RATHER, IN ANYTHING AT ALL.
DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT USING IT.
STUFF _WILL_ BREAK.
YOU _WILL_ CRY.
WE WILL _NOT CARE_.**

This repo contains a standalone version of the
_still in development_ ANTLR4 Parser feature of the
[ProB Parsers Library](https://github.com/hhu-stups/probparsers).

The code is still in a very early and experimental state.
Just do not use it unless you have contacted us
and we deemed usage of this library suitable for your goals.


## Using the Parser on the Command Line

You can use gradle to parse a FILE like this:
```
	./gradlew run -Pfile="FILE"
```
To disable type checking (which can still be slow and is less powerful than ProB's typechecking) you can do this:

```
	./gradlew run -Pfile="FILE" -Ptypecheck="false"
```

You can also build a stand-alone JAR like this:
```
	./gradlew shadowJar
```

You can then use it as follows:

```
	time java -jar build/libs/antlr-parser-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar $(FILE) false
```

Note this is more or less equivalent to using [ProB](https://prob.hhu.de/)'s SableCC parser (available in ProB's lib folder):
```
	time java -jar probcliparser.jar FILE -prolog -time
```

## Limitations

Compared to ProB's parser there are still quite a few limitations:
- no support for DEFINITIONS
- no support for pragmas
- no support for locating files in the stdlib folder of ProB (LibraryStrings.def, ...)
